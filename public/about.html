<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Fun enriches your life" is a qoute I've read in Feel Good Productivity book by Ali Abdaal and I believe is a good introduction.
  I am in my mid twenties and I enjoy listening to music but with limited genre. I love using audiophile instrument in listening to music such as Headphones, speakers, and In-Ear-Monitors.

<p>I work in our family business of selling medicine; Pharmacy.<br /> Everyday I go to each pharmacy we own to check our employees, tend to their needs such as deliveries of low stock medicines, asking them of what needs to be adjusted; what is lacking and report it to our procurement manager.<br />
There's also the weekly documentation; I like doing things legally, it makes me proud to be ready whenever documentation is a topic.
</p>

<p>In my free time, I am learning to love to read books; mostly books that focuses on self-improvement but sometimes I like reading graphical novels like Manga. One of my interests is playing RPG games(i.e. Skyrim, Fallout, Divinity, etc.)<br />
It's also in my interest to travel the world and I am slowly planning that by self learning different language and I am currently trying to learn Nihonggo(Japanese).
